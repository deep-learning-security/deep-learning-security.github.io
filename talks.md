## An Implementation of Web Application Firewall Based on a Deep Nerual Network Detection Engine.
Most enterprises provide Web services open to the public and thus are prone to Web attacks. Among these attacks, SQL Injection (SQLi) is a very serious threat, which could lead to catastrophic data leaking and loss. Lots of research efforts have been devoted into SQLi detection areas thereafter and heuristic rule based Web Application Firewall (WAF) was invented and deployed for protections. However, subtle and carefully crafted SQLi attacks can still easily hide themselves from being detected. Deep learning methods were introduced in recent years and they have shown a great strength to learn and describe complex semantic contents. In this talk, we present a CNN based SQLi detection implementation, which also has an ability to propose locations of suspect attack payloads within an URL request. Experimental results show that our implementation outperforms a leading method called Libinjection and our current version Alibaba Cloud WAF.
