## Prerequisites and Preparation Instructions

All students attending the hands-on lab should ensure that they have the following software packages installed and ready to use:

* Python
* TensorFlow (0.12) with GPU support if available.
  * [Installation instructions.](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup)
* NumPy and SciPy.
  * [Installation instructions.](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
* Matplotlib.
  * [Installation instructions.](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

In addition to installing the packages, students should also familiarize themselves with these tools beforehand. We recommend the following tutorials:

* [TensorFlow Getting Started Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage)
* [Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

If you would like to use some other computing framework or models already prepared for other frameworks in addition to TensorFlow-based models, you can find the instructions here:

* Torch
  * [Installation instructions.](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
* Cafe
  * [Installation instructions.](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)<br/>
  * [Converting Cafe models to TensorFlow.](https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-tensorflow)
