title: Deep Learning Security Research Forum
---

# Overview

The research forum aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners, showcasing developments at the intersection of
deep learning and security. The forum is part of a two-day
[event](https://deep-learning-security.github.io/) in
Singapore on Dec 14th and 15th, featuring leading experts
working in this space. This forum invites submissions for
'work-in-progress' or short research talks.  Talks can include
emerging hot topics, preliminary research results, practical
problems encountered by industry practitioners, lessons
learned, exciting datasets, and other topics of interest to
security researchers working in deep learning. The forum
will be offering scholarships for a number of students
invited as speakers to cover costs of travel and stay for
the event. 

To participate as a speaker, please submit a research talk
proposal as per the submission guidelines below. Submissions
can be authored by teams. The organizing committee will
select a set of finalist teams, who will be invited to
present their work in-person at the forum. Talks will be
divided into 3 tracks:

**Datasets**: Talks showcasing the creation of new datasets
to spur research activity

**Real-world Applications**: Talks showcasing interesting
real-world applications of deep learning in security

**Models, Techniques and others:** Talks discussing research
on new deep learning models, techniques for analysis of
models, adversarial learning techniques, privacy-preserving
deep learning, and other topics of interest. 

Presentations in each track will be evaluated for one or more
awards by the organizing committee. The forum will include an
evening networking session open to all attendees, invited
companies, and students from universities in Singapore. 

Submission guidelines and deadlines: All talk proposal
submissions are expected to be in ACM style double-column,
4-page, 10-point format to merit consideration by the organizers.
Proposal submissions are due on November 5th, 2017 11:59 pm PST.
[TBD]
The final acceptance notification for the main talks will be
within one week of the submission deadline. Proposals will be
judged on novelty, practical relevance and technical depth.
